title: What can be deleted
---

You can delete the following files and archives (the theme may break though, if there are still references to them):

- `github.js` in `src/_data/`
- `builtwith.json` in `src/_data/`
- all the blog posts, as these serve only as an example
- the directory and all files in `src/docs`
- all pages in `src/pages`, though you might want to keep `index.njk` as a starting point
- You can delete `screenshots`, `blog` and `gallery` in `src/assets/images`.
  Keep the `favicon` and `template` folders though.

If you don't want to feature any code examples, you may delete the whole stylesheet for syntax highlighting: `src/assets/css/blocks/code.css`.
